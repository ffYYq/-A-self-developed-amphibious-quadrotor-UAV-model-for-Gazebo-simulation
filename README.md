- 👋👋👋
- 😄😄😄Hello, UAV enthusiasts! 
- 🌱I'm Fu Yiqi, a graduate student at the school of Civil Aviation of Northwestern Polytechnical University, under the supervision of Professor Dang Qingqing. My research focuses on intelligent algorithms for UAVs.
- 💞️Sincerely welcome to visit our website: https://wangfujian.github.io 
- 👀 This project, developed by me and my team, features a specialized UAV that combines the conventional characteristics of a quadrotor with the ability to navigate on water surfaces. 
To test various algorithms and flight performance, we have created a Gazebo simulation model with parameters identical to those of the actual UAV for use in Gazebo simulations.
